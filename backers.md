# Support Clio

I want to thank everyone who shows interest in Clio and supports Clio
by contributing to it or by donating to it.

In this file you will find a list of all people who have supported Clio
by giving donations.

If you like Clio you can help in several ways.

As a community, we need people to spread the word about Clio.
We also need people to help us write better documentation, tutorials,
examples, demos, tests and bug fixes.

I appreciate your generous donations, as it will help me spend even more
time on developing Clio.

If you want to donate you can do so on [our patreon](https://www.patreon.com/pouya) page.
